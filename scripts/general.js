        that would allow you to save precious animal lives,

     <h2>What is Meat-Free?</h2> 
     <p>Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy / milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific shop / deal for further information.
    </p>

        <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/businesses.htm">Businesses Page.</a></p>
    <h2>What is a Username?</h2>
    <p>A Username is a nickname exclusively used to identify your profile. It will be used to access your Public Page, such as
        <a href="https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername">https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername</a> and it will also be displayed when you share KindMoments, comments and reviews.
    </p>
    <h2>How do KindMeal deals work?</h2>
    <p>Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can obtain coupons 
        for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal sites in that you do not need to make 
        any upfront payment at KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile 
        or laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require advance reservations, 
        you can even use the LiveCoupon
         immediately! After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?</p>
         <h2>How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</h2>
         <p>Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get Coupon. Please note that the outlet
             location cannot be changed after the coupon is obtained.</p>
             <p>
                Each member is limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the coupons before you can obtain additional ones.
                 Unused coupons will automatically expire upon reaching its due date.</p>
                 <h2>What is KindWords?</h2>
                 <p>KindWords is a great way to tell your friends about the great food and instantly get more discount.</p>
                 <p>For deals with KindWords enabled, you can enjoy DOUBLE the discount if you share the deal on Facebook 
                    or Twitter. Once you successfully share it, you will immediately receive the exclusive discount for
                     your deal. If you prefer not to take advantage of KindWords, you can still proceed to get the deal at 
                     the normal discount price. Please note that not all deals support KindWords - 
                    it depends on the merchant.</p>
           <h2>How do I use my KindMeal LiveCoupon?</h2>
           <p>Once a coupon is received, you can access the LiveCoupon and use it via one of the 
            following ways. An Internet connection is required.</p>
              <li>At KindMeal website, under Account -> <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/member/index.php?action=coupons"> My Coupons </a> section</li>
              <li>With our KindMeal mobile app, under Deals -> My Coupons section</li>
              <p>You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the restaurant, and upon 
                informing the merchant. Some merchants may require that you activate it during the ordering process,
                 while some will be during the payment process. 
                Please inform the merchant first when you are ordering to ensure they are aware of your KindMeal LiveCoupon.</p>
      <p>Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer counting down the time remaining to use it. To activate it, click on Use LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate 
        it upon the request of the merchant. Activating it ahead of
         time may void your coupon and deal.</p>
<h2>What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use a Print Coupon?</h2>
<p>This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. Please refer to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage delay are required.</p>
<p>
    To print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the Account->Account -> My 
    Coupons section, then click on Print Coupon at the corresponding coupon. If the Print Coupon button is 
    not available, it means that only LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.</p>
  <h2>What is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</h2>
  <p>Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay of a certain number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.</p>
   <p>
    You may wish to check with the merchant first before using it. We strongly suggest using a LiveCoupon instead, which is immediate with no usage delays.</p>
<h2>How do I create a shop and offer deals?</h2>
<p>You need to first sign up a <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/joinshop.htm"> merchant account</a>. If you have an existing food lover account, we can upgrade it for you to enable the Merchant functions. To do so, please <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/contact.htm">contact us</a> and tell us more about your shop.</p>
<p>Once your merchant account is activated, you can find out more details at the Merchant Help section.</p>
<h2>Do I need to make any payments to get the deal coupons?</h2>

<p>No, absolutely no payment is required at KindMeal to obtain your coupon. You will only need to make payment at the restaurant when you use the coupon to purchase your food.</p>
<h1>What is a KindMoment?</h1>
<p>A KindMoment is a food selfie, a photo moment of your delicious food for sharing with the world, and to encourage meat-free dining. Sharing a KindMoment is extremely quick and easy, 
similar to other social photo sharing websites or mobile apps.</p>
<p>If you link your KindMeal account with Facebook, you can also automatically publish your latest KindMoments there. On top of
 that, you can also manually share on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
 <p>
    The public can like and comment on your KindMoments, and you can also edit the KindMoment after publication.</p>

<h2>What is Food Menu?</h2>
<p>Restaurants can additionally showcase meat-free dishes and menu items. These items are different from deals, and there may not be offers available for them. You can discover interesting new food through our menu listings, and browse the corresponding restaurants for more information. To search for specific types of food or restaurants, go to the search section at the bottom of the page.

<button>Got In Touch</button>`,`        <h1>The World's 1st Meat-Free Lifestyle Platform</h1>


<h2>How It All Began</h2>
<p>Founded by Andy Koh in 2008, <a href="https://www.petfinder.my/">PetFinder.my</a> has been working hard with nationwide animal 
    shelters, rescuers, and pet lovers to improve Malaysia's animal welfare. Much of our 
    focus was centered upon pets — specifically, dogs and cats (alright, we have rabbits,
     hamsters, birds, fishes, turtles and chickens too).</p>
     <p>However, there exists a very real burden for all people involved in animal 
        welfare: the challenging demand of their time, effort and money. It is no easy task
         being a rescuer, and only a tiny fraction of animal lovers are able to be actively involved in such
          onerous tasks. How do we widen the circle of people in animal welfare,
         and make it so attractive and simple that anyone can participate?</p>
<p>
    Thus, the concept of KindMeal was born. A platform for anyone, irregardless of age, gender or financial status,
     to save lives anywhere, anytime. Without requiring any effort, time or money. In fact, they can even SAVE money. 
     Sounds too good to be true, eh? Don't worry, this is not a pyramid scheme.</p>
<img src="https://www.kindmeal.my/images/about-1.jpg" alt="">
<h2>Saving Lives With Delicious Meals</h2>
<p>How does eating food help save animal lives? Isn't food consumption just for saving our own lives?</p>
<p>Actually, the concept is really simple. Unless you are a vegetarian or vegan (which we salute you for), most of us are taking the lives of
     animals every single day. These animals — be it chickens, cows, lambs, ducks, pigs or fishes, are equally precious
      lives, and deserve our kindness and compassion as much as our beloved pets.</p>
<p>They experience joy, pain, hunger, love and sadness similar to us. Just because we are not able to communicate well with them, make them fetch a ball or keep them as pets in our homes, we tend to neglect their well-being and shift our focus to the so-called delicious taste of their meat.</p>
<p>We understand that it may not be easy to become a full vegetarian, but we strongly believe that it is feasible and achievable for all of us to reduce meat consumption, 
be it for compassion, health or environmental reasons. If we eat a couple of meat-free meals a week, it effectively means that we
 would be consistently saving the lives of many animals each month which would otherwise have ended up in our bellies.</p>
<p>
We have been accustomed to delicacies and cuisines made of meat, but it need not remain so. There exists a wide variety of 
meat-free food that are delicious and nutritious, and more often than not, cost less than similar meals with meat.</p>

<p>So, how do we get started?</p>
<h2>The KindMeal Vision</h2>
<p>To promote this concept, our team worked round the clock for months and months (we forgot what the sun looks like) to introduce a unique and exciting platform to promote meat-free dining.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to just tell people the benefits of meat-free dining. We have to give them good, practical reasons for trying it out, and it has to be simple, effective, and of course, enjoyable.</p>
<p>KindMeal attempts this by closely working with restaurants and cafes to offer attractive meat-free deals and cozy dining environments. Everyone loves good food and great bargains!</p>
<p>The restaurants need not be strictly vegetarian, as long as the deals and food they promote on KindMeal are meat-free. We want food lovers to be able to enjoy meat-free meals conveniently, including at their existing favorite restaurants.</p>
<p>Our platform offers a structured, effective way for restaurants to promote themselves, with a proper showcase of their shop, menu, deals and outlets. Getting and using deal coupons are extremely simple, it only takes ONE single click — no online payment, advance planning, coupon printing or reservation required. Even your pet can do it. Eating is all about spontaneity, right?</p>
<p>The KindWords and KindMoment features are carefully crafted to encourage viral promotion of restaurants and the meat-free dining experience, creatively leveraging on social media to strengthen the cause. Consumers can DOUBLE their deal discounts by sharing it on social media, and camwhore with the delicious food to show their friends (Malaysians LOVE taking photos of their food, perhaps even more than eating it).</p>  
<p>Ultimately, it is a cycle of supply and demand. The more food lovers that try out such meals, the more encouraged restaurants are in introducing creative meat-free menu items, which would in turn attract more people into compassionate dining.</p>
<p>This will not happen overnight, but we have to start somewhere and help it materialize.</p>

<h2>Of Factory Farming & Global Warming</h2>
<p>60 billion farm animals are slaughtered each year for our pleasure. Factoring in marine lives, it reaches a whopping 2 TRILLION each year.</p>
<p>Most of us are aware of the issues brought forth by such widespread consumption. Inhumane farm conditions where animals live perpetually in dirty, packed and tortorous environments before being carelessly slaughtered. Animals are force-fed to introduce more fats in them, pre-emptively given antibiotics to keep them alive, incapacitated to prevent them from accidentally harming each other in overpacked environments — these are but a few examples of their voiceless sufferings, unfortunate lives that are bred to be killed, to satisfy the whims and fancies of us civilized humans.</p>
<p>We are experiencing global food shortage because so much of the agriculture land is used for planting animal feed. If such lands were used for feeding humans, bypassing the animal food chain, it would be so much more efficient, with lower food prices and much less blood on our hands.</p>
<p>Did you know that the biggest contributor of global warming is the gas emitted by cows? Yes, they fart. A lot. A single cow releases as much greenhouse gases as a car driving 12,000km per year. Now multiply that by 1,500,000,000 cows</p>
<p>There is a wealth of resources and literature out there on why we should reduce meat consumption, so we won't delve into it in detail. But you get the drift.</p>
